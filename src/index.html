				<p class="content__p">The clinical studies are more than promising...</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<ul class="list">
			<li class="list__item"><strong>Berberine keeps your metabolism humming:</strong> Berberine can influence the genes that control your metabolism. ‍You see, there are certain genes that, when turned on, can slow down your metabolism. <strong>Berberine forces these genes into a headlock, blocking their ability to ruin your waistline.</strong><sup>7</sup></li>
			<li class="list__item"><strong>From Couch Potato To Lean Athlete?</strong> One study turned chubby, couch-potato rats into athletic hard bodies by dosing them with berberine. Rats given berberine <strong>lost sizeable chunks of weight</strong> compared to the control group that <em>gained </em>weight without berberine. (Plus, another rat experiment showed berberine lowered fasting glucose levels and boosted glucose tolerance.)<sup>8</sup></li>
		</ul>
		<p class="content__p"><strong>But we’re just scratching the surface:</strong></p>
		<ul class="list">
			<li class="list__item"><strong>Dropped <em>Pounds </em>of Fat: </strong>In a 12-week long study, overweight men and women were given 500 mg of berberine 3 times a day... they<strong> lost an average of 5 pounds, and 3.6% of their body fat.</strong><sup>9</sup></li>
			<li class="list__item"><strong>Body Mass Index Plummeted:</strong> The second study was for 3 months, during which 37 individuals with metabolic Complex were given 300 mg of berberine 3 times per day. These patients saw their body mass index (BMI) drop from 31.5 to 27.4, <strong>lost significant amounts of belly fat</strong>, and saw improvement in several other markers of health<sup>10</sup></li>
			<li class="list__item"><strong>Flushes Out Fatty Acids:</strong> Another study took 60 people with type 2 diabetes, dosed them with berberine, and measured free fatty acids (fats that float around in your blood after they&#x27;re freed from fat cells). Free fatty acids are bad news for your pancreas and have been linked to insulin resistance. <strong>Berberine lowered levels of free fatty acids in those given the compound.</strong><sup>11</sup></li>
		</ul>
		<p class="content__p">The bottom line is that Berberine optimizes your body to behave just like it did in your youth. </p>
		<p class="content__p"><strong>It kickstarts your AMPK, commanding each cell to get “lean and mean.”</strong></p>
		<p class="content__p"><strong>So your cells will actually <em>use</em> your blood sugar for energy, instead of storing it as fat.</strong> As the <em>Natural Medicine Journal</em> states:</p>
		<div class="quote content__p">
			<p class="quote__p"><em>“</em><strong><em>…activating AMPK can produce the same benefits as exercise, dieting, and weight loss</em></strong><em>.

		<p class="content__p">Needless to say, I was <em>so</em> excited about my patients’ results. </p>
		<p class="content__p">And it got me thinking… what could I do to ENHANCE the power of Berberine for my patients?</p>
		<p class="content__p">In my research I uncovered a variety of nutrients that not only <em>enhance</em> the effect of Berberine but tackle the scourge of Fat Loss Resistance Complex on their own. </p>
		<p class="content__p">Combined, they form a true <em>powerhouse</em> formula that, I believe, will help us make major strides in the war against middle age weight gain… and the serious health challenges that come along with it.</p>
		<p class="content__p">That’s why, in addition to berberine, I encourage patients to consider supplementing with an additional THREE fat-fighting nutrients:</p>

				<p class="content__p">In one 8-week study chromium picolinate lowered food intake and crushed the cravings and hunger pangs in overweight women.<sup>14</sup></p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p class="content__p">How does it work? Researchers believe Chromium Picolinate helps your brain use its fuel (glucose) more efficiently. And the data appears to back that up…</p>
		<p class="content__p">So much so, in another 8-week study, they tested 113 people suffering from depression and even <em>they</em> found appetite and cravings were reduced after supplementing with chromium picolinate.<sup>15</sup></p>

				<p class="content__p">That means the carbs pass right through your body undigested. Your body can’t absorb the calories and no new fat is formed. Want proof?</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p class="content__p">A study published in <em>The Journal of Applied Research</em> in 2010 showed that taking white bean extract 15 minutes before each meal <strong>led to a reduction in both weight and waist circumference.</strong></p>
		<p class="content__p">In another study, overweight individuals were given 3,000 mg of <strong>White Kidney Bean Extract</strong> daily or placebo and ate a normal-calorie diet, rich in carbohydrates. After 8 weeks those taking the White Kidney Bean <strong>lost an average of 3.8 lbs</strong>. Those getting the placebo lost only an average of 1.65 lbs.<sup>16</sup></p>
		<p class="content__p">And in yet another study, using a much <em>lower </em>dose of the Extract &mdash; 445 mg &mdash; once per day, participants <strong>lost 6.6 pounds </strong>compared to 0.8 pounds among those taking placebo. They also enjoyed significantly greater reductions in fat mass and waist circumference.<sup>17</sup></p>

		<p class="content__p">I truly believe natural fat-fighting nutrients are our greatest weapon in tackling America’s plague of obesity.</p>

	<div class="content container">
		<p class="content__p">Extracted from red wine grapes, the research behind this powerhouse antioxidant keeps getting more and more compelling.</p>
		<p class="content__p">You see, it’s thought Resveratrol is created to protect red wine grapes from the“stress” of being deprived of water and exposed to scorching sunlight. </p>
		<p class="content__p">And we now believe resveratrol’s protective benefits get “transferred over” to our cells when you and I consume it.</p>
		<p class="content__p">For example, multiple studies have proven – beyond a shadow of a doubt – that resveratrol activates AMPK.<sup>18</sup> <sup>19</sup></p>
		<div class="row flex-row">
			<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
				<p class="content__p">Its weight-loss benefits are well-documented. One study showed that mice treated with resveratrol showed improved resistance to weight gain on a high-fat diet.<sup>20</sup></p>

			</div>
		</div>
		<p class="content__p">That’s <em>exactly</em> what the right dose of Resveratrol can do.</p>
		<p class="content__p">It reduces the accumulation of triglycerides, <em>and</em> activates lipolysis… that’s the fancy scientific term for saying it breaks down fats!<sup>21</sup></p>
		<p class="content__p">Resveratrol also appears to act on adiponectin, a protein produced by our fat cells and helps us lose fat by improving insulin sensitivity. </p>
		<p class="content__p">Not only that, but according to a Purdue University study, resveratrol may even <em>block </em>immature fat cells from developing AND prevent <em>existing</em> fat cells from growing.</p>
